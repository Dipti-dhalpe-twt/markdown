# Introduction
Providing services over internet for example data storage, networking, software instead of maintaining physical server and data canter is called as cloud computing.
The cloud allows users to store and access data and applications over the internet rather than on their own hard drives or local servers. Cloud services follow a pay-as-you-go model that eliminates the large upfront capital investment in physical infrastructure. Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand, making it ideal for businesses with fluctuating workloads.
Data and applications can be accessed from any device with an internet connection that enables remote work and collaboration.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a broad set of services that help businesses and individuals to build, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud with ease, scalability, and flexibility. AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure platform that supports a variety of workloads, ranging from simple websites to complex machine learning applications.
